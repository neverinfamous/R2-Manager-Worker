### 4. Set Up Code Owners (Optional but Recommended)
Create `.github/CODEOWNERS`:
```
# Default owners
* @neverinfamous

# Specific areas

/src/ @neverinfamous
```

### 5. Configure Labels
Go to **Issues ‚Üí Labels** and create/organize these:
- `bug` - Something isn't working

- `dependencies` - Dependency updates
- `security` - Security concerns
- `good first issue` - For newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed
- `ci` - CI/CD related
- `javascript` - JavaScript/TypeScript related

### 6. Configure Issue Management
Go to **Settings ‚Üí General**:
- [ ] Enable issues: **On**
- [ ] Enable discussions: **Optional** (recommended for community)
- [ ] Enable wiki: **Off** (use docs folder instead)
- [ ] Enable projects: **Off** (can enable later)

### 7. Set Up Notifications
Go to **Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Email notifications**:
- [ ] Notify on CodeQL scanning
- [ ] Notify on Dependabot alerts
- [ ] Notify on secret scanning

## üìä Automated Workflows Status

### Current Status
All workflows are ready to use once you push code:

| Workflow | Status | Runs On |
|----------|--------|---------|
| CodeQL | ‚úÖ Ready | Push to main, PRs, weekly |

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How do I enable CodeQL scanning?
A: CodeQL is already configured and will run automatically on the next push to main. Results will appear in the Security tab.

### Q: How do I manage Dependabot PRs?
A: They're in the Pull Requests tab. Patch/minor updates auto-merge. Major versions need manual review and merge.

### Q: What if a secret is detected?
A: The action will fail, and you'll need to remove the secret and rotate any exposed credentials before pushing again.

### Q: Can I skip workflow checks?
A: Not recommended, but branch protection rules can have exceptions. Avoid if possible for public release.

### Q: Do workflows cost money?
A: No, GitHub Actions is free for public repositories with unlimited usage.
