# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all people. We pledge that participation in our community is a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, caste, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, family status, gender, immigration status, marital status, national origin, personal appearance, political belief, political identity, pregnancy status, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, tribe, veteran status, or any other dimension of diversity.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Encouraging and supporting new contributors

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting the project maintainers directly. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
