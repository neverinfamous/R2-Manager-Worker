# Cloudflare R2 Bucket Manager - Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values

# ============================================
# WORKER API ENDPOINT
# ============================================
# Development: Point to local worker
VITE_WORKER_API=http://localhost:8787

# Production: Leave empty or comment out to use deployed domain automatically
# The application will use window.location.origin if not set
# VITE_WORKER_API=https://your-worker.your-domain.com
# VITE_WORKER_API=https://your-worker.workers.dev

# ============================================
# NOTES
# ============================================
# - For local development with wrangler dev, use http://localhost:8787
# - For production deployment, either:
#   1. Leave VITE_WORKER_API unset (recommended - uses same domain as frontend)
#   2. Set to your custom domain if worker is on a different domain
# - The .env file is gitignored for security
