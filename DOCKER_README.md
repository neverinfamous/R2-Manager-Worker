## 🔄 Upgrading

### Database Schema Updates

If you're upgrading from a previous version and want to enable new features like individual action logging (file uploads, downloads, deletes, etc.), run the schema migration:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute r2-manager-metadata --remote --file=worker/schema.sql
```

> **Note:** This command is safe to run multiple times - it uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` so existing tables are not affected. If you haven't run this migration, the application will continue to work normally but individual actions won't be logged in Job History.

### Version-Specific Upgrades

**Upgrading to v3.0.0 or later:**
- Job History requires a D1 database. See the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/neverinfamous/R2-Manager-Worker/wiki/Installation-&-Setup) for setup instructions.
- Rate limiting requires a Cloudflare Workers paid plan.
- AI Search requires the `[ai]` binding in your wrangler.toml.

---

## 🔍 Filtering & Search

### Basic Filtering
- Search by filename/folder name
- Filter types: All / Files Only / Folders Only
- Real-time results counter
- Clear button to reset filters

### Advanced Filtering
- **Extension Filter:** Images, Documents, Videos, Code, Archives, or custom
- **Size Filter:** Preset ranges or custom min/max in MB
- **Date Filter:** Today, Last 7/30/90 days, This Year, or custom range
- **Active Filter Badges:** See all active filters with one-click removal
- **Filter Statistics:** Total size and date range of results

## 🙈 Hiding Buckets from the UI

You can configure R2 Bucket Manager to hide specific buckets from the UI (e.g., system buckets, internal buckets, or buckets managed by other applications).

### How to Hide Buckets

1. **Edit `worker/index.ts`:**
   - Locate the `systemBuckets` array (around line 373)
   - Add your bucket name(s) to the array

```typescript
const systemBuckets = ['r2-bucket', 'sqlite-mcp-server-wiki', 'your-bucket-name'];
```

2. **Deploy the changes:**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

### Example

To hide buckets named `blog-wiki` and `internal-data`:

```typescript
const systemBuckets = ['r2-bucket', 'sqlite-mcp-server-wiki', 'blog-wiki', 'internal-data'];
```

**Note:** Hidden buckets are completely filtered from the API response and won't appear in the bucket list or be accessible through the UI. This configuration must be done in the source code before deploying.

**📖 See the [Configuration Reference](https://github.com/neverinfamous/R2-Manager-Worker/wiki/Configuration-Reference#hiding-buckets) for more details.**

## 🏗️ Local Development with Docker

### Mock Operations in Development Mode

When running without Cloudflare credentials, the development server returns simulated responses for UI testing:

- ✅ **List buckets** - Returns `dev-bucket`
- ✅ **Create bucket** - Simulates success
- ✅ **Rename bucket** - Simulates success
- ✅ **List files** - Returns empty array
- ✅ **Upload files** - Simulates success (files not stored)
- ✅ **Create folders** - Simulates success

**Note:** Mock data enables UI/UX testing without Cloudflare API access. Files and folders are not actually stored. Authentication and rate limiting are automatically disabled for localhost development. For full functionality with real storage, provide Cloudflare credentials or deploy to production.

### Option 1: Use Pre-built Image

**Step 1: Pull the image**
```bash
docker pull writenotenow/r2-bucket-manager:latest
```

**Step 2: Run the container**
```bash
docker run -p 8787:8787 writenotenow/r2-bucket-manager:latest
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

**Step 1: Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neverinfamous/R2-Manager-Worker.git
```

**Step 2: Navigate to directory**
```bash
cd R2-Manager-Worker
```

**Step 3: Build the image**
```bash
docker build -t r2-manager-local .
```

**Step 4: Run the container**
```bash
docker run -p 8787:8787 r2-manager-local
```

---

## 🛡️ Security

- ✅ **Zero Trust Architecture** - Cloudflare Access authentication
- ✅ **JWT Validation** - Token verification on every API call
- ✅ **Rate Limiting** - Tiered API rate limits (production only, requires paid plan)
- ✅ **HTTPS Only** - Encrypted via Cloudflare edge
- ✅ **Signed URLs** - HMAC-SHA256 for downloads
- ✅ **No Stored Credentials** - Zero password storage

**Note:** Rate limiting requires Cloudflare Workers paid plan and is not available in Docker development mode.

---

## 📚 Production Deployment

**Note:** This Docker image is designed for **development and testing**. For production deployment:

1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers: `wrangler deploy`
3. Configure Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust)
4. Set up custom domain (optional)

See the [Installation & Setup Guide](https://github.com/neverinfamous/R2-Manager-Worker/wiki/Installation-&-Setup) for complete production deployment instructions.
