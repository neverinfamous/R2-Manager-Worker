## 🎯 Why It Exists

Cloudflare's dashboard lacks full-featured R2 file management capabilities. This tool provides a self-hosted alternative for developers and enterprises wanting complete control over their R2 buckets, advanced file operations, and seamless SSO integration. Perfect for teams that need more than the dashboard offers but want to stay on the Cloudflare edge network.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🪣 **Bucket Management** - Create, rename, and delete R2 buckets
- 📤 **Smart Uploads** - Chunked uploads with automatic retry (10MB chunks, up to 500MB files)*
- 📥 **Bulk Downloads** - Download multiple files as ZIP archives
- 🔄 **File Operations** - Move and copy files between buckets
- 🔐 **Enterprise Auth** - GitHub SSO via Cloudflare Access Zero Trust
- ⚡ **Edge Performance** - Deployed on Cloudflare's global network
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Beautiful, responsive interface built with React 19

**\*Upload Size Limits:** This application supports uploads up to 500MB per file for archives and videos. However, **Cloudflare enforces plan-based limits**:
- **Free/Pro Plans:** 100MB maximum per file
- **Business Plan:** 200MB maximum per file  
- **Enterprise Plan:** 500MB maximum per file

If you attempt to upload files larger than your plan allows, Cloudflare will reject the upload.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) (Free tier works! See upload limits above)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ and npm
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed globally
- Domain managed by Cloudflare (optional - can use Workers.dev subdomain)

**Note:** For uploads larger than 100MB, you'll need a Cloudflare Business (up to 200MB) or Enterprise (up to 500MB) plan.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neverinfamous/R2-Manager-Worker.git
   cd R2-Manager-Worker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   
   Copy the template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Then edit `.env` and set for local development:
   ```
   VITE_WORKER_API=http://localhost:8787
   ```

4. **Configure Wrangler**
   
   Copy the template:
   ```bash
   cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml
   ```
   
   Then edit `wrangler.toml` and update these fields:
   - `bucket_name` - your R2 bucket name
   - `database_name` and `database_id` - your D1 database details
   - (Optional) custom domain routing

5. **Create Cloudflare resources**
   
   Login to Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   ```
   
   Create R2 bucket (replace `your-bucket-name`):
   ```bash
   npx wrangler r2 bucket create your-bucket-name
   ```
   
   **Note:** Bucket names must:
   - Only contain lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (-)
   - Not begin or end with a hyphen
   - Be between 3-63 characters in length
   
   Create D1 database (replace `your-database-name`):
   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 create your-database-name
   ```
   
   Copy the `database_id` from the output. When prompted "Would you like Wrangler to add it on your behalf?", select `No` (you'll add it manually to `wrangler.toml`).
   
   Initialize database schema:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 execute your-database-name --remote --file=worker/schema.sql
   ```

6. **Configure Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust)**

## 🛠️ Development

### Local Development

**Terminal 1: Start Vite dev server**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Frontend available at `http://localhost:5173`

**Terminal 2: Start Wrangler worker**
```bash
npx wrangler dev
```
Worker API available at `http://localhost:8787`

**Important Notes about Local Development:**
- Cloudflare Access authentication is **not enforced** on localhost during development
- JWT validation will be skipped for local requests
- For testing with authentication:
  - Deploy to production and test there, OR
  - Use your deployed Worker URL in `.env`: `VITE_WORKER_API=https://your-worker.workers.dev`
- Local development uses `--local` flag by default, which doesn't require secrets to be set
- To test against remote resources (D1, R2), use `npx wrangler dev --remote`

### Build Commands

Run any of these commands individually:

**Start Vite dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Build for production:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Run ESLint:**
```bash
npm run lint
```

**Preview production build:**
```bash
npm run preview
```

**Start local worker:**
```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

**Deploy to Cloudflare:**
```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

### Technical Notes

**ES Modules Configuration:**
- `package.json` includes `"type": "module"` to ensure proper ES module support with Vite 7+
- This configuration avoids subtle import/export syntax issues and ensures consistent behavior across the project
- All source files should use ES6 import/export syntax (not CommonJS)

**Wrangler Configuration:**
- The `wrangler.toml` is configured with both local and production environments
- Local development uses `--local` flag by default (no secrets required)
- Production deployment automatically binds your R2 bucket and D1 database based on `wrangler.toml` settings

## 🔌 API Endpoints

All endpoints require valid Cloudflare Access JWT (automatically handled by Cloudflare Access).

**Base URL:** `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api`

### Bucket Management

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/buckets` | List all R2 buckets |
| `POST` | `/buckets` | Create bucket (Body: `{ "name": "bucket-name" }`) |
| `PATCH` | `/buckets/:name` | Rename bucket (Body: `{ "newName": "new-name" }`) |
| `DELETE` | `/buckets/:name` | Delete bucket (Query: `?force=true` to delete all objects first) |

**Note on Bucket Rename:** Since R2 doesn't have native bucket rename functionality, this operation performs a copy of all objects to the new bucket followed by deletion of the original. Ensure adequate rate limits during this operation on large buckets.

### File Management

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/files/:bucket` | List objects in bucket (Query: `?limit=20&skipCache=true`) |
| `POST` | `/files/:bucket/upload` | Upload file (Headers: `X-Chunk-Index`, `X-Total-Chunks`, `X-File-Name`) |
| `DELETE` | `/files/:bucket/:file` | Delete single file |
| `POST` | `/files/:bucket/:file/move` | Move file (Body: `{ "destinationBucket": "target" }`) |
| `POST` | `/files/:bucket/:file/copy` | Copy file (Body: `{ "destinationBucket": "target" }`) |
| `POST` | `/files/:bucket/delete-multiple` | Delete multiple files (Body: `{ "files": ["file1", "file2"] }`) |
| `POST` | `/files/:bucket/download-zip` | Download files as ZIP (Requires `X-Signature` header) |

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

### How It Works

1. **User visits your domain** → Cloudflare Access intercepts unauthenticated requests
2. **GitHub SSO login** → User authenticates via GitHub OAuth
3. **JWT cookie issued** → `cf-access-jwt-assertion` cookie set automatically
4. **Worker validates JWT** → Every API request validates JWT against Cloudflare's public keys
5. **Access granted** → User can manage R2 buckets

### Security Features

- ✅ **Zero Trust Architecture** - All requests authenticated by Cloudflare Access
- ✅ **JWT Validation** - Tokens verified on every API call using `jose` library
- ✅ **HTTPS Only** - All traffic encrypted via Cloudflare's edge network
- ✅ **Signed URLs** - Download operations use HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- ✅ **No Stored Credentials** - No user passwords stored anywhere
- ✅ **Policy Enforcement** - Access policies managed in Cloudflare dashboard

### Authorization

By default, all authenticated users can access all buckets. To restrict access:

1. Update Cloudflare Access policies to specific GitHub users/orgs
2. Modify worker JWT validation to check user email against allowlist
3. Implement per-bucket ownership in D1 database (requires code changes)

## ⚙️ Configuration Reference

### Environment Variables (.env)

| Variable | Required | Description | Example |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VITE_WORKER_API` | No* | Worker API endpoint | `http://localhost:8787` (dev)<br>`https://r2.yourdomain.com` (prod) |

*If not set, uses `window.location.origin` (same domain as frontend)

### Worker Secrets (via `wrangler secret put`)

| Secret | Required | Description | Where to Find |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `ACCOUNT_ID` | Yes | Cloudflare account ID | Dashboard → Overview |
| `CF_EMAIL` | Yes | Cloudflare account email | Your login email |
| `API_KEY` | Yes | API token with R2 permissions | Dashboard → API Tokens |
| `TEAM_DOMAIN` | Yes | Zero Trust team domain | Zero Trust → Settings |
| `POLICY_AUD` | Yes | Access application AUD tag | Access → Applications |

### Wrangler Configuration (wrangler.toml)

Key settings to customize in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
name = "r2-manager-worker"
main = "worker/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

# R2 Bucket binding
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "BUCKET"  # Variable name used in your Worker code
bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"  # Must match the bucket you created

# D1 Database binding
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"  # Variable name used in your Worker code
database_name = "your-database-name"  # Name of your D1 database
database_id = "your-database-id"  # UUID from wrangler d1 create output

# Custom Domain (optional - for production deployment)
# Option 1: Custom Domain (recommended)
[[routes]]
pattern = "r2.yourdomain.com"
custom_domain = true

# Option 2: Route with existing DNS (if you have an origin server)
# [[routes]]
# pattern = "r2.yourdomain.com/*"
# zone_name = "yourdomain.com"

# Workers.dev subdomain (enabled by default)
# Your Worker will be accessible at: https://r2-manager-worker.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

**Important Notes:**
- `bucket_name` must exactly match the R2 bucket you created
- `database_id` is the UUID shown when you ran `wrangler d1 create`
- For custom domains, your domain must be active on Cloudflare
- Custom domains automatically create DNS records and SSL certificates
- The `binding` values (e.g., `BUCKET`, `DB`) are how you access these resources in your Worker code

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**❌ "Failed to authenticate" error**
- Verify `TEAM_DOMAIN` includes the full URL: `https://yourteam.cloudflareaccess.com`
- Confirm `POLICY_AUD` matches the Application Audience Tag in Zero Trust dashboard
- Check your GitHub account is allowed in the Access policy
- Clear browser cookies and try re-authenticating
- Verify the JWT cookie `cf-access-jwt-assertion` is being set (check browser DevTools → Application → Cookies)

**❌ "Bucket not found" error**
- Run `npx wrangler r2 bucket list` to verify the bucket exists
- Ensure `bucket_name` in `wrangler.toml` exactly matches the created bucket (case-sensitive)
- Verify `ACCOUNT_ID` secret is correct
- Check your API token has R2 Storage permissions

**❌ "Database error" messages**
- List databases: `npx wrangler d1 list`
- Verify schema is initialized: `npx wrangler d1 execute <db-name> --remote --command="SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'"`
- Confirm `database_id` in `wrangler.toml` matches the UUID from `wrangler d1 create` output
- Ensure your API token has D1 Edit permissions

**❌ Worker deployment fails**
- Re-authenticate: `npx wrangler login`
- List secrets to verify they're set: `npx wrangler secret list`
- Check for build errors: `npm run build`
- Verify `wrangler.toml` syntax is correct (especially multiline arrays)
- Ensure your API token has Workers Scripts Edit permission

**❌ CORS errors in browser**
- Verify Cloudflare Access application domain matches your Worker domain
- Create a Bypass policy for static assets (`/favicon.ico`, `/logo.png`, etc.)
- Check that API requests include credentials: `credentials: 'include'` in fetch calls
- Ensure the Worker is deployed to the correct domain

**❌ Upload fails with large files (>100MB)**
- Check your Cloudflare plan: Free/Pro plans are limited to 100MB per file
- Business plans support up to 200MB per file
- Enterprise plans support up to 500MB per file
- The application allows up to 500MB uploads, but Cloudflare will reject files exceeding your plan's limit
- Upgrade your plan at [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) → **Plans** to increase limits

### Testing JWT Authentication

Test JWT validation with curl:

```bash
curl -H "Cookie: cf-access-jwt-assertion=YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/buckets
```

**To get your JWT token:**
1. Open your browser and log in to your deployed Worker
2. Open DevTools (F12) → **Application** tab → **Cookies**
3. Find `cf-access-jwt-assertion` and copy its value
4. Replace `YOUR_JWT_TOKEN` in the curl command above
5. Replace `YOUR_DOMAIN` with your Worker's domain

**To verify JWT payload:**
1. Copy your JWT token
2. Visit [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)
3. Paste the token in the "Encoded" section
4. Verify:
   - `iss` matches your team domain: `https://<team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`
   - `aud` contains your Application Audience Tag
   - Token is not expired (check `exp` timestamp)

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging in your Worker:

1. Add logging to `worker/index.ts` at the top of the fetch handler:

```typescript
console.log('Request:', {
  url: request.url,
  method: request.method,
  headers: Object.fromEntries(request.headers),
  jwtToken: request.headers.get('cf-access-jwt-assertion') ? 'Present' : 'Missing'
})
```

2. View real-time logs:
```bash
npx wrangler tail
```

3. Or view logs in the dashboard:
   - Go to **Workers & Pages** → Select your Worker → **Logs** tab
   - Real-time logs show all console.log output and errors
