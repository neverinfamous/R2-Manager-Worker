# Cloudflare R2 Bucket Manager

**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025 | **Status:** âœ… Production Ready  
**Tech Stack:** React 19.2.0 | Vite 7.1.10 | TypeScript 5.9.3 | Cloudflare Workers

The Cloudflare R2 Manager is a Vite-powered React application backed by a Cloudflare Worker that proxies Cloudflare R2 and D1. The web client lets you authenticate, create, edit and delete buckets, upload objects with chunked retries, delete files, move files between buckets, and download multi-file archives, while the worker mediates all requests, issues signed URLs, and stores session metadata.

## Key capabilities

- Account login with session persistence through the worker.
- Bucket CRUD (create, list, delete) surfaced directly in the UI.
- Drag-and-drop uploads with MIME/type validation, 10 MB chunking, and exponential backoff retries.
- Object browser with previews, multi-select actions, and ZIP download bundling.
- Inline delete actions for individual objects or selected groups.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js 25.x LTS** (minimum 18+, but 25.x is installed and recommended)
- **npm** (latest - comes with Node.js)
- **Cloudflare account** with R2 and D1 enabled
- **Wrangler CLI** for deploying the worker

Optional: VS Code + ESLint/TypeScript extensions improve DX.

---

## Quick Start

### Frontend setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure the worker API base URL:
   - Default: `https://r2.adamic.tech` (production)
   - For local dev, create `.env`:
     ```bash
     echo "VITE_WORKER_API=http://localhost:8787" >> .env
     ```
   - Update `src/services/api.ts` to read from `import.meta.env.VITE_WORKER_API`

3. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Opens at `http://localhost:5173`

### Available npm scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Launch Vite dev server with HMR (hot module replacement) |
| `npm run build` | Type-check + create production bundle in `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve built bundle locally for smoke testing |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint using project configuration |

---

## Worker Deployment

The worker at `worker/index.ts` provides REST endpoints for authentication, bucket management, object CRUD, and signed download URLs.

### Required Bindings (wrangler.toml)

| Binding | Type | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `R2` | R2 | Primary R2 bucket for object storage |
| `DB` | D1 | Session/user store (schema in `worker/schema.sql`) |
| `ASSETS` | KV/Static | Optional - serve SPA from Workers Sites |

### Required Secrets

```bash
npx wrangler secret put ACCOUNT_ID
npx wrangler secret put CF_EMAIL
npx wrangler secret put API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put REGISTRATION_CODE
npx wrangler secret put URL_SIGNING_KEY
```

### Deployment Process

```bash
# Authenticate with Cloudflare
npx wrangler login

# Create D1 database and apply schema
npx wrangler d1 create <database-name>
npx wrangler d1 execute <database-name> --file worker/schema.sql

# Build and deploy
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy
```

For local development:
```bash
npx wrangler dev  # Runs on http://localhost:8787
```

## Development Notes

### Performance Tips
- Upload logic chunks files at 10 MB; adjust worker limits and R2 settings if changed
- Auth tokens stored in `sessionStorage` (can migrate to HTTP-only cookies via `src/services/auth.ts`)
- Client-side ZIP creation uses JSZip - large bundles may exhaust browser memory

### Key Code Patterns
- Functional React components with hooks (useCallback, useEffect, useState, useMemo)
- Type-safe React 19 with explicit JSX imports
- Vite 7 optimized build pipeline (47 modules transformed vs 52 before)

### Maintenance
- Run `npm audit` monthly for security updates
- Check for patch updates quarterly
- Monitor React 20 and Vite 8 releases (currently on stable versions)

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Build is slow  
**Solution:** Verify you're on Vite 7.1.10 - should complete in ~2.45s

**Issue:** Type errors in editor  
**Solution:** Run `npm run build` to ensure tsconfig is applied; check `src/filegrid.tsx` uses React 19 patterns

**Issue:** Import resolution errors  
**Solution:** Clear `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

**Issue:** Worker not responding locally  
**Solution:** Ensure `npx wrangler dev` is running and `.env` has correct `VITE_WORKER_API=http://localhost:8787`

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Maintenance:** Add feature to copy files between buckets
2. **Enhancement:** Switch login to Cloudflare Worker SSO (Zero Trust + GitHub)
3. **Monitoring:** Set up automated dependency updates (Dependabot/Renovate)
4. **Enhancement:** Auto-detect user's ligh/dark settings and match it.
5. **Long-term:** Add AWS S3 bucket support with bidirectional S3 - R2 migration
