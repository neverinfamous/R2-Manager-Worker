## Release Notes

### Version 1.2.0
This minor release adds the highly requested **cross-bucket search** feature, allowing users to search for files across all buckets from the main page. The new search interface includes powerful filtering options (extension, size, date) and displays results in a sortable table with full file operations (download, move, copy, delete). This release also includes **bulk bucket deletion**, major code refactoring for improved maintainability, and several important bug fixes including file transfer path logic and rename operations.

**Key Features:**
- **Cross-Bucket Search:** Search all buckets at once with advanced filters
  - Real-time search with 300ms debounce for optimal performance
  - Filter by extension (Images, Documents, Videos, Code, Archives, custom)
  - Filter by size (preset ranges or custom min/max)
  - Filter by date (preset ranges or custom date picker)
  - Sortable results table (filename, bucket, size, date)
  - Full file operations from search results (download, move, copy, delete)
  - Server-side parallel search for fast results across many buckets
- **Bulk Bucket Deletion:** Select and delete multiple buckets at once
  - Visual checkbox selection with highlighting
  - Progress bar and status tracking
  - Force delete removes all files automatically
- **Bug Fixes:** Fixed file transfer path logic, rename operations, and ESLint configuration

### Version 1.1.0
MERGED INTO 1.2.0 - Originally planned for bulk bucket deletion feature.

### Version 1.0.1
